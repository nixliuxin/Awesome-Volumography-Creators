# Cursor Rules & Project Guidelines

## Language Policy
- **Code & Comments**: All source code, variables, function names, and comments MUST be in **English**.
- **Commits**: All git commit messages MUST be in **English** and follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- **Documentation**: Technical documentation and README within the repo should be in **English**.
- **Discussion**: While we may discuss in other languages (e.g., Chinese), the technical output remains English-only for global accessibility and consistency.

## Project Vision
- **Volumography** is a portmanteau of **Volumetric + Photography**.
- It is an umbrella term for all 3D/4D capture technologies (Gaussian Splatting, NeRF, Photogrammetry, LiDAR, etc.).
- We treat this as a new independent artistic paradigm.

## Collaboration Rules
- The `website/data/creators.json` is the Single Source of Truth for creator data.
- When adding a new creator, update both the README and the JSON file.
- Prefer high-quality avatars; if missing, use the default placeholder.
