# Awesome Volumography Creators 🌌

> **Volumography**: A portmanteau of **Volumetric** + **Photography**. It is the new paradigm for creative applications of 3D/4D scanning, serving as an umbrella term for technologies like **Gaussian Splatting**, **NeRF**, **Photogrammetry**, and **LiDAR**.

## 📢 Manifesto

We believe that **Volumography** is the next universal medium, succeeding photography and cinema. It is not just a technical process, but a new independent artistic paradigm. 

- **Beyond the Camera**: We are moving from capturing 2D projections to capturing the essence of volumes and spatial experiences.
- **The Next General Medium**: Just as photography captured the moment and cinema captured time, Volumography captures the very fabric of reality as a navigable, immersive experience.
- **Reality as Medium**: The real world is no longer just a subject, but a raw material for digital sculpture and spatial storytelling.
- **Open Collaboration**: By bridging the gap between cutting-edge research (Gaussian Splatting, NeRF) and artistic expression, we accelerate the future of spatial computing.

This list is a portal to the pioneers of this vision. It is part of [Creative.Tech](https://creative.tech).
