# Awesome Volumography Creators 🌌

> **Volumography**: A portmanteau of **Volumetric** + **Photography**. It serves as an umbrella term for the emerging field of 3D/4D scanning and reconstruction, including **Gaussian Splatting**, **NeRF**, **Photogrammetry**, and **LiDAR**.

`#GaussianSplatting` `#Photogrammetry` `#NeRF` `#LiDAR` `#4DGS` `#VolumetricVideo`

A curated list of artists, researchers, and pioneers pushing the boundaries of 3D/4D scanning, Gaussian Splatting, NeRFs, and volumetric storytelling.

## 📢 Manifesto

We believe that **3D/4D Scanning & Reconstruction** is not just a technical process, but a new independent artistic paradigm. 

- **Beyond the Camera**: We are moving from capturing 2D projections to capturing the essence of volumes.
- **Reality as Medium**: The real world is no longer just a subject, but a raw material for digital sculpture.
- **Open Collaboration**: By bridging the gap between cutting-edge research (Gaussian Splatting, NeRF) and artistic expression, we accelerate the future of spatial computing.

This list is a portal to the pioneers of this vision. It is part of [Creative.Tech](https://creative.tech).
